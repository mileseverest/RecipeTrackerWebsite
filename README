# RecipeTrackerWebsite
Very Basic Recipe Tracking Website

This project is a recipe tracking website that I am developing using PHP, MySQL Database, Javascript, HTTP, and CSS.
This is a very basic version of this project as I am still dveloping this website in my freetime, but this is the initial version. Current features are adding recipes, deleting recipes, and rating recipes.
I am working on a more fluid UI as well as adding notes to recipes.
